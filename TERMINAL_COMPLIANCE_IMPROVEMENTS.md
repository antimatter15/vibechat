# Terminal Compliance Improvements

This document outlines the terminal compliance improvements made to the VibChat application to make it behave more like a native terminal application.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Exit Behavior with Confirmation

**Supported Exit Keys:**
- `Ctrl+D` (standard EOF behavior)
- `Ctrl+C` (standard interrupt signal)
- `Escape` (existing behavior)

**Exit Confirmation:**
- First press of any exit key shows a warning: "Press [key] again to exit"
- Warning is displayed in red text in the footer
- Second press within 3 seconds actually exits the application
- Warning automatically clears after 3 seconds if no second press occurs
- Warning clears immediately if user presses any other key

### 2. Improved User Feedback

**Footer Messages:**
- Updated footer to include keyboard shortcuts: "Use /nick <name> to change username â€¢ Ctrl+D/Ctrl+C: exit"
- Exit warning messages take priority and are displayed in red
- Existing network error and disabled warnings remain functional

### 3. Terminal-like Keyboard Handling

**Global Keyboard Events:**
- Enhanced `useInput` hook to handle multiple exit key combinations
- Proper event handling with timestamp tracking for confirmation timeout
- Non-destructive - other keyboard functionality remains intact

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

1. **State Management:**
   ```typescript
   const [exitWarning, setExitWarning] = useState(null);
   const [lastExitAttempt, setLastExitAttempt] = useState(null);
   ```

2. **Enhanced useInput Hook:**
   ```typescript
   useInput((input, key) => {
     const now = Date.now();
     
     // Handle multiple exit keys with confirmation
     if (key.ctrl && input === 'd') {
       handleExitAttempt('Ctrl+D', now);
       return;
     }
     // ... similar for Ctrl+C and Escape
   });
   ```

3. **Exit Confirmation Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const handleExitAttempt = (keyName, timestamp) => {
     const CONFIRMATION_TIMEOUT = 3000; // 3 seconds
     
     if (lastExitAttempt && 
         lastExitAttempt.key === keyName && 
         timestamp - lastExitAttempt.timestamp < CONFIRMATION_TIMEOUT) {
       // Second press within timeout - actually exit
       exit();
     } else {
       // First press - show warning
       setExitWarning(`Press ${keyName} again to exit`);
       // ... timeout handling
     }
   };
   ```

## Limitations

### Ctrl+W Word Deletion

**Issue:** The `ink-text-input` component handles keyboard events internally and doesn't expose a way to override specific key combinations like Ctrl+W.

**Attempted Solutions:**
- Custom wrapper component with keyboard interception
- Global keyboard handling with input value manipulation

**Result:** Ctrl+W word deletion is not supported due to `ink-text-input` architectural limitations.

**Alternative:** Users can still use standard terminal editing keys that are supported by the underlying text input component.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Only Escape key could exit
- Immediate exit without confirmation
- Risk of accidental application closure
- No visual feedback for keyboard shortcuts

### After
- Multiple standard terminal exit keys (Ctrl+D, Ctrl+C, Escape)
- Safe exit with confirmation requirement
- Clear visual feedback with warning messages
- Documented keyboard shortcuts in footer
- 3-second timeout prevents accidental exits

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Development mode (`npm run dev_unlocked`)
- All three exit key combinations
- Confirmation timeout behavior
- Integration with existing chat functionality
- No regression in existing features

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Custom text input component to support Ctrl+W
2. Additional terminal shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E for line navigation)
3. Vim-style key bindings option
4. Configurable keyboard shortcuts

## Conclusion

These improvements make the VibChat application feel more like a native terminal application while maintaining all existing functionality. The exit confirmation prevents accidental closure, and the multiple exit key options provide familiarity for terminal users.

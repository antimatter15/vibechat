A Chatroom for when you are bored waiting for Claude

## Quick Start 

```bash
npx vibechat
```

## How it works

It monitors `.claude/projects/**.jsonl` to detect when there are active Claude Code sessions. If it detects that claude is actively working, it unlocks a chatroom where you can talk to other people who are also waiting for Claude to finish. When all the claudes are finished, you are kicked out of the chatroom.
